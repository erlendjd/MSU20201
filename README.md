AZ-304 + Exam

Between these course there is ALOT of crossover of material. We will be using the Microsoft slide decks and labs for these courses in addition to more material.

Each of theses courses are taught normally over 4 days each, we have much more time than this. A good portion of the time in this course will need to be self study upon behalf of the student.

These exams are not easy, and at the end of a course under normal public course conditions the recommendation is to study for a couple of weeks after the course to prep for the exam. We do not have that luxury. 

If you work hard for the next few weeks, study and read all the material set out for you, then you will have the knowledge to be able to take and pass the exams without any problems.

The case studies will also be provided for you to work upon and complete during the course, they will include some scenarios for you to build and test for you to  work upon the Azure platform.
